# Secure Password Generator

## Description

This page was created at the request of an employer who wanted to be able to generate passwords for his employees based on a series of criteria the employee was able to select. The page allowed me to practice using prompts, alerts, confirms, arrays, "if statements," and "for loops" in Javascript.

## Installation

The website has been installed and deployed on [Github](https://github.com/).

## Usage

This website is used to generate a secure password.  The user selects the desired password length between 8 and 128 characters, as well as which character sets to include in the password (lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and symbols). Any combination of character sets may be used, but at least one must be used.

### Code Snippets

```
const lowChar = ["a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j","k","l","m","n","o","p","q","r","s","t","u","v","w","x","y","z"]
const upperChar = ["A","B","C","D","E","F","G","H","I","J","K","L","M","N","O","P","Q","R","S","T","UV","W","X","Y","Z"]
const numbers = ["0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9"]
const symbols = ["!","@","#","$","%","^","&","*","(",")","[","]"]
```

This code block creats global arrays of the four character selection types: lower case, upper case, numbers, and symbols.

```
  var confirmLength = prompt("Choose a password length.")
    if (confirmLength < 8) {
      return alert("Password must be between 8 and 128 characters.");
    } else if (confirmLength > 128) {
      return alert("Password must be between 8 and 128 characters.");
    } else if (confirmLength >= 8 <= 128) {
      var confirmLow = confirm("Do you want to use lowercase letters?")
      var confirmUp = confirm("Do you want to use uppercase letters?")
      var confirmNum = confirm("Do you want to use numbers?")
      var confirmSym = confirm("Do you want to use special characters?")
        if (!confirmLow && !confirmUp && !confirmNum && !confirmSym) {
          return alert("You must select at least one character set!");
            }
    }
```
This code block prompts the user to choose a password length, returning an alert that the password must be between 8 and 128 characters if that condition is not met. It saves the inputted value in the var confirmLength, which comes into play later.

It then asks a series of confirmation questions, creationg a true/false value for each answer. If no selections are made, it returns an alert that at least one character set must be chosen.

```
var preRandPW = []
    if (confirmLow) {
      preRandPW = preRandPW.concat(lowChar)}
    if (confirmUp) {
      preRandPW = preRandPW.concat(upperChar)}
    if (confirmNum) {
      preRandPW = preRandPW.concat(numbers)}
    if (confirmSym) {
      preRandPW = preRandPW.concat(symbols)
    }
```

This code block creates the empty array preRandPW, and for each true value from the confirmation prompt, concatinates the corresponding character selection array into the empty array preRandPW.

```
var genPW = ""
    for (var i = 0; i < confirmLength; i++) {

    genPW = genPW + preRandPW[Math.floor(Math.random() * preRandPW.length)];
    }
    return genPW;
```

This code block creates a new empty string called genPW. It then runs a 'for loop' n times, where n = the value assied to confirmLength in the prompt. Each time the loop runs, it pulls a random element from the preRandPW array and adds it to the string genPW. Finally, it returns the randomly generated password to the window.
